Things that went wrong when making simple_por that need to be fixed:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Resistors in the PDK don't simulate correctly (not getting length
    and width) (ngspice/primitives library issue).

(2) Capacitors in the PDK don't handle M correctly (behave as if it
    is not there and defaults to 1) (ngspice/primitives library issue).

(3) PDK pre-processor is not parsing the metal stack in the device
    generator script.  It gets METALS5 correct but not THICKMET0P9;
    mim_2p0fF_draw has top_type = m5 (correct) but contact_size =
    0.36 (not correct).

    (Fixed---note that "#elseif" in preproc.py is defined like
    "elseifdef" because "#elseif defined(...)" does not work.)

(4) Even after fixing (3), the contact spacing on the cap needed to
    be corrected.
    (Fixed)

(5) Crosshair is missing from magic's Option window
    (Fixed)

(6) Magic reports "MV P-field overlap" error (DF.5).  Pwell should
    be purely optional, right?  Otherwise, sub surround for pwell/
    substrate should be 0.16um.
    (Complicated;  rule is for deep nwell only;  probably okay to
     use for no well, but strictly speaking not an error.  Fixed
     by adding the 0.16um surround in the generator script.)

(7) mvpmos is created with an nsubdiff guard ring, NOT mvnsubdiff.
    Caused by compose rules.
    (Fixed in tech file)

(8) ppolyf_u_1k and ppolyf_u_1k_6p0:  Fixed the GDS input/output rules
    while working on the layout.  However, there are multiple issues
    both with the rule checking and the device generation.  Needs a
    lot of work.

    The biggest issue is that the contact must be an exact distance
    from the resistor.  This will need to be somehow enforced by
    DRC rules, maybe??

(9) ppoly and mim (all res and cap) use different names for length and
    width and need to be fixed in "res_convert" and "cap_convert".
    (Fixed)
    
(10) All combinations of LV and MV diff are not allowed, but MV FET +
     LV guard ring is not flagged (guard ring is transformed on
     tapeout;  needs check for MV vs. LV well, such as is in sky130)
     (Rule DV.9)
     (Fixed)

(11) Need separate 6v device for high-sheet-rho poly.
     (Fixed)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

(12) MiM cap rules need fixing.  In particular, the bottom plate
     spacing rule, and bottom plate surround of contact.  No
     "cifsurround" rule, so will need to construct a cifwidth rule.
